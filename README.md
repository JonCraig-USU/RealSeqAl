# RealSeqAl
##### Real Sequence alignment advanced algorithms

## Observtions
1) The DP algorithm proved itself to be very fast while still keeping reliability 
2) This algorithm would allow scientist to do a job that would have taken many people hours if not days to do in a matter of a few, unsupervised, over night hours of the computer which would enable them to track mutations of the virus as it moves around the globe

## Graph
The graph shows that the relationship between the length of the strains and the time spent is exponential with a function {C * A^n} where A is approximately 1.002. This gives us a graph that while exponential, grows at a much slower rate. Especially when compared to the recursive form.

## Closing
The DP algorithm, while still time intensive, is much faster than it's recursive cousin allowing for a quicker study of DNA structures and their mutations. This shows that there is plenty potential uses for good code in various fields.
